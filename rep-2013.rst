Abstract
========

This REP will document, retroactively, the aspects and expectations of language-specific client libraries in ROS 2 in order to serve as a template for new language communities and client libraries which can be integrated into ROS.
In particular this REP is an attempt to elaborate on the questions raised on ROS Discourse [1]_ regarding incorporating third-party client libraries into the ROS 2 core.

==============================

  * rosidl pipeline
  * colcon
  * rosdep
  * bloom

Languages and ecosystems
========================

  * C, C++, and CMake
  * python and PyPI
  * Rust and Crates

Alternative approaches
======================
